# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Rent-a-Car API** built with Spring Boot 3.5.5 and Java 21, providing a comprehensive car rental management system with JWT authentication and role-based authorization.

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
# Run the application (local profile with H2 database)
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Run with specific profile
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev

# Build the application
./mvnw clean package

# Run tests
./mvnw test

# Run specific test class
./mvnw test -Dtest=CarServiceIntegrationTest

# Run specific test method
./mvnw test -Dtest=CarServiceIntegrationTest#carLifecycleAndAvailability

# Clean and rebuild
./mvnw clean compile
```

### Database
```bash
# Check database migrations
./mvnw flyway:info

# Run migrations
./mvnw flyway:migrate

# Reset database (WARNING: destructive)
./mvnw flyway:clean flyway:migrate
```

## Architecture Overview

### Domain Model
The application follows a layered architecture with distinct domain entities:

**Core Entities:**
- **Car**: Vehicle inventory with soft delete capability (uses `@Where(clause = "deleted = false")`)
- **Reservation**: Customer bookings with overlap prevention logic
- **Customer**: Customer information with driver license validation
- **Branch**: Rental locations where cars are picked up/dropped off
- **User/Role**: Authentication system with ADMIN/EMPLOYEE/CUSTOMER roles
- **Employee**: Staff members associated with branches
- **Maintenance**: Car maintenance records and scheduling
- **Payment**: Payment processing for reservations

### Key Business Logic

**Reservation Pricing:** 
- Calculated as `dailyPrice × numberOfDays` (no taxes/fees included per business rules)
- Overlap validation prevents double-booking of cars

**Car Management:**
- Cars use **soft delete** (others use hard delete)
- Availability filtering considers reservation overlaps and car status

**Security:**
- JWT-based authentication using Nimbus library
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Different endpoints protected by different roles

## Environment Profiles

- **local**: H2 in-memory database (default)
- **dev**: Local PostgreSQL database
- **test**: Testcontainers with PostgreSQL for integration tests  
- **prod**: Production PostgreSQL with placeholders

## Key Configuration Notes

### Database
- Uses **Flyway** for migrations (located in `src/main/resources/db/migration/`)
- **Long** type used for all entity IDs
- Audit fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`) handled by `BaseEntity` with JPA auditing

### Testing
- Integration tests use `@SpringBootTest` with `@ActiveProfiles("test")`
- **Testcontainers** used for PostgreSQL in test environment
- Custom `AuditingTestConfig` for consistent test timestamps

### Security
- JWT tokens with configurable expiration
- Password encoding with BCrypt
- CORS configured for local development
- Method-level security enabled with `@EnableMethodSecurity`

## Data Seeding

Initial data is created via Flyway migration `V2__seed_roles_and_admin.sql`:
- **Admin user**: `admin`/`admin123`
- **Employee user**: `john.doe`/`admin123`
- Sample branches, cars, customers, and reservations

## MapStruct Integration

The project uses MapStruct for DTO-Entity mapping with Spring component model:
- Configured in `pom.xml` with annotation processor
- Mappers are Spring beans (auto-injected)
- Custom mapping logic for complex transformations

## Important Implementation Details

1. **Car Soft Delete**: Cars use `deleted` boolean flag with `@Where` clause
2. **Reservation Overlaps**: Prevented in service layer with date range queries
3. **JWT Configuration**: Separate properties for different environments
4. **Validation**: Bean validation annotations on DTOs and entities
5. **Exception Handling**: Global exception handler for consistent API responses

## Testing Strategy

- **Integration Tests**: Full Spring context with real database (Testcontainers)
- **Service Layer Focus**: Core business logic testing
- **Entity Manager Clearing**: Tests simulate transaction boundaries
- **Date-based Logic**: Reservation availability and overlap scenarios
